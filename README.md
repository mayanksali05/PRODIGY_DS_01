# PRODIGY_DS_01
 First task of prodigy online data science internship.

 Task 1 - Create bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical and continuous variable on Billionaires Statistics Dataset.

1. **Final Worth by Gender**:
   - The pie chart shows the distribution of final worth based on gender.
   - It has two segments: one for males (labeled 'M') and another for females (labeled 'F').
   - The chart visually represents the relative worth attributed to each gender.

2. **Final Worth by Category**:
   - The bar graph displays final worth categorized by different categories.
   - Categories are shown on the horizontal axis, and their corresponding worth values are on the vertical axis.
   - This chart provides insights into how worth varies across different categories.

3. **Final Worth by First Name**:
   - The second bar graph represents final worth based on first names.
   - Each first name is plotted along the horizontal axis, and its associated worth value is shown on the vertical axis.
   - Analyzing this chart can reveal patterns related to first names and their worth.

4. **Final worth by regionwise**:
   - Visualize the final worth based on regions.

Overall, these visualizations help understand the distribution of final worth based on gender, category, and first names.
